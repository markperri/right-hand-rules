# Right-Hand-Rules

This is a simple set of web-based exercises to help students practice
right-hand-rules for magnetic forces and fields. The program is
written as a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and intended to
be run with [Voilà](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html)
so that students do not need to see or excute the underlying code.

# Running as a Voilà App

Try it:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tluchko/right-hand-rules/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2Findex.ipynb)

To run the notebook using Voila on your local server, first [install
Voilà](https://voila.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).  Then the
notebook can be launched from the commandline:

    voila --no-browser right-hand-rules.ipynb

Note that we have used the `--no-browser` argument, so you will have to
copy and paste the URL into your browser.  This is best if you are
using a remote machine as the server but can be omitted if you are
running locally.
